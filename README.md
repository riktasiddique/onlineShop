## About This Project

This is a web-based E-Commerce Project. From here buyer can buy Grocery products. Any valid user can register here to buy any products. We have an dashboard panel to control this site. Users have three roles which is:
- Customer
- Admin
- Super Admin

## Customer: 
They can purchase any product from this site and also can add any product to cart and also can select product to wishlist so thay can purchase in future.

## Admin an Super Admin: 
They can block or unblock any user and also can change user role at any time but they can not able to change itself. Admin have an limit that they can not be able to change Super Admins role.

## Feature
- Change role and Block any user: To control all users we have some admin and
super admin users. They can change users’ roles at any time but they can’t change
their roles and we have a block or unblock option. If any user does something
wrong instantly we can block the user. After blocking any user they can be able
to see some pages. Like if we block any admin or super-admin they can’t be able
to visit the dashboard page and if he or she is a seller she can’t be able to post an
ad.

- Update and delete a product: Sellers who posted a product to sell they can be able to update and delete their posted product at any time.

- Search option: Our system has a search box by using this you can search prod-
ucts by using product name, price, product category name.

- User unique email validation: Another important feature in our system is using a
valid and unique email address. This means you can not be able to register in our
system if you are already registered with existing mail address.
